ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification Project ðŸŒ¸

The Iris flower dataset is a classic example in Machine Learning, featuring three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each species has unique measurements, and the goal is to train a model to classify them accurately.

Using the dataset, I worked on building a machine learning model to learn from these measurements and make predictions. A simple yet powerful project to understand the fundamentals of ML!
